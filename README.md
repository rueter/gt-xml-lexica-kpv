Giellatekno xml lexica for Komi-Zyrian (Permic, Uralic)

This material has been undergoing development in the Giellatekno infrastructure since 2004.

The material originated with vocabulary work for Evgeni Tsypanov's Komi Zyrian reader. It has since been augmented using work by Vasili Lytkin (1962).
